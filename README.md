=======
Task 1:
-------
I guess the formula computes the gradient of the lossfunction of the [n-1] hidden layer of the neural network and is part of the backpropagation algorithm.
* Case a) popably indicates that layers at the beginning of the neural net dont get that much effected of the backpropagation then the layers near the output.
* Case b) The propagation effects all layers the same
* Case c) opposite than case a)
