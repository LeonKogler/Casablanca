SoftwareDev Tasks:
=======
Task 1:
-------
1. MergeSort Algorithm can be find under: ConsoleApp1/Programm.cs
2. Tests can be find under: TestProject1/TestMergeSort.cs

Task 2:
-------
DomainModel can be found in the Dom√§nenModel.jpg file

Task 3:
-------

NeuralNetwork/RAG/LLM Tasks:
=======
Task 1:
-------
I guess the formula computes the gradient of the lossfunction of the [n-1] hidden layer of the neural network and is part of the backpropagation algorithm.
* Case a) popably indicates that layers at the beginning of the neural net dont get that much effected of the backpropagation then the layers near the output.
* Case b) The propagation effects all layers the same
* Case c) opposite than case a)

Task 2:
---------
The Workflow of the RAG-Application can be found in the RAG-Workflow.pdf

Task 3/4:
-------
I am very very sorry but due to some university deadlines and my planned vacation starting at 10.12.2024 i have to let the last two tasks empty :(

Summary:
=======
My strengths lie primarily in software development, where I have solid experience and understanding. In the Neural Network (NN) and LLM domains, I have hands-on experience but less theoretical depth.
